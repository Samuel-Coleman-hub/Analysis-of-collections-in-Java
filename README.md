 Description
 ------------
 This program is designed to read data from a CSV file and insert it into three different data structures, we then
 perform methods on these different data structures in order to search, delete and create the data.
 
 How to use
-------------
To use this program you will need to run the main method in the input class. This will print the ASCII file to the
console and will also export the data to a CSV file by default (the CSV file can be found in the projects folder).
You can then use the console in order to input an entry or to create the performance stats text file by following the
instructions in the console.
